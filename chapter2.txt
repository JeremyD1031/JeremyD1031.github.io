Heading elements are organized into six

levels: h1 through h6. The text within a head-
ing element is rendered as a “block” of text by

the browser (referred to as block display) and
appears with empty space (sometimes called
“white space” or “negative space”) above and
below. The size of the text is largest for <h1>
(called a heading 1 tag) and smallest for <h6>
(called a heading 6 tag). Depending on the font
being used, the text within <h4>, <h5>, and
<h6> tags may be displayed smaller than the
default text size. All text within heading tags is
displayed with bold font weight.
Figure 2.1 shows a web page document with
six levels of headings.

FIGURE 2.1 Sample heading.html.

Hands-On Practice 2.1
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.1, launch a text editor and open the
template.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the title element
and add heading tags to the body section as indicated by the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Heading Example</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
</body>
</html>

Heading Element 29

Save the document as heading.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser
such as Edge or Firefox to test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in
Figure 2.1. You can compare your work with the solution found in the student files
(chapter2/heading.html).

FIGURE 2.2 Heading tags outline the page.

Accessibility and Headings
Heading tags can help to make your pages more accessible and usable. It is good coding
practice to use heading tags to outline the structure of your web page content. To indicate
areas within a page hierarchically, code heading tags numerically as appropriate (h1, h2,
h3, and so on), and include page content in block display elements such as paragraphs
and lists. In Figure 2.2, the <h1> tag
contains the name of the website in the
logo header area at the top of the web
page, the <h2> tag contains the major topic
or name of the page in the content area,
and other heading elements are coded
in the content area as needed to identify
subtopics.
Visually challenged visitors who are using
a screen reader can configure the software
to display a list of the headings used on
a page in order to focus on the topics that
interest them. Your well-organized page
will be more usable for every visitor to
your site, including those who are visually
challenged.
More Heading Options in HTML5
You may have heard about the HTML5 header element. The header element offers additional
options for configuring headings and typically contains an h1 element. We’ll introduce the
header element later in this chapter.

Why doesn’t the heading tag go in the head section?

It’s common for students to try to code the heading tags in the head section of the docu-
ment, but someone doing this won’t be happy with the way the browser displays the web

page. Even though “heading tag” and “head section” sound similar, always code heading tags in the body
section of the web page document.

30 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics
Paragraph
Element

A paragraph element groups sentences and sections of text together. Text within <p> and
</p> tags is rendered as block display with empty space above and below.
Figure 2.3 shows a web page document containing a paragraph after the first heading.

FIGURE 2.3 Web page using headings and a paragraph.

Hands-On Practice 2.2
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.3, launch a text editor and open the
heading.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the page title and
add a paragraph of text to your page below the line with the <h1> tags and above the line
with the <h2> tags:

Paragraph Element 31

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Paragraph Example</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<p>This is a sample paragraph. Heading tags can help to make your
pages more accessible and usable. It is good coding practice to use
heading tags to outline the structure of your web page content.
</p>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
</body>
</html>
Save the document as paragraph.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser
to test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.3. You can compare
your work with the solution found in the student files (chapter2/paragraph.html). Notice how
the text in the paragraph wraps automatically as you resize your browser window.

Alignment
As you test your web pages, you may notice that the headings and text begin near the left
margin. This is called left alignment, and it is the default alignment for web pages. There
are times when you want a paragraph or heading to be centered or right aligned (justified).
In previous versions of HTML, the align attribute can be used for this. However, the align
attribute is obsolete in HTML5, which means that the attribute has been removed from the
W3C HTML5 specification. You’ll learn techniques to configure alignment with Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) in Chapters 6 through 8.

When writing for the Web, avoid long paragraphs. People tend
to skim web pages rather than reading them word for word.
Use heading tags to outline the page content along with short
paragraphs (about three to five sentences each) and lists (which you’ll learn
about later in this chapter).

32 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics
Line Break and
Horizontal Rule

The Line Break Element
The line break element causes the browser to
advance to the next line before displaying the next
element or text on a web page. The line break tag
is not coded as a pair of opening and closing tags.
It is a void element and is coded as <br>. Figure
2.4 shows a web page document with a line break
after the first sentence in the paragraph.
Hands-On Practice 2.3
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.4, launch
a text editor and open the paragraph .html file from
the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the

text between the title tags to be “Line Break Exam-
ple.” Place your cursor after the first sentence in the

paragraph (after “This is a sample paragraph.”). Press the Enter key. Save your file. Test your

page in a browser and notice that even though your source code displayed the “This is a sam-
ple paragraph.” sentence on its own line, the browser did not render it that way. A line break

tag is needed to configure the browser to display the second sentence on a new line. Edit the
file in a text editor and add a <br> tag after the first sentence in the paragraph as shown in
the following code snippet:
<body>
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<p>This is a sample paragraph. <br> Heading tags can help to make your
pages more accessible and usable. It is good coding practice to use
heading tags to outline the structure of your web page content.
</p>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
</body>
Save your file as linebreak.html. Launch a browser to test your page. It should look similar
to the page shown in Figure 2.4. You can compare your work with the solution found in the
student files (chapter2/linebreak.html).
FIGURE 2.4 Notice the line break after the first sentence.

Line Break and Horizontal Rule 33

The Horizontal Rule Element
Web designers often use visual elements
such as lines and borders to separate or
define areas on web pages. The horizontal rule
element, <hr>, configures a horizontal line
across a web page. Since the horizontal rule
element does not contain any text, it is coded
as a void element and not in a pair of opening
and closing tags. The horizontal rule element
has an additional purpose in HTML5, it can be
used to indicate a thematic break or change
in the content. Figure 2.5 shows a web page
document (also found in the student files at
chapter2/hr.html) with a horizontal rule after
the paragraph. In Chapter 6, you’ll learn how
to configure lines and borders on web page
elements with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Hands-On Practice 2.4
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.5, launch a text editor and open the
linebreak.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the text between the
title tags to be: Horizontal Rule Example. Place your cursor on a new line after the </p>
tag. Code the <hr> tag on the new line as shown in the following code snippet:
<body>
<h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
<p>This is a sample paragraph. <br> Heading tags can help to make your
pages more accessible and usable. It is good coding practice to use
heading tags to outline the structure of your web page content.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
<h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading Level 6</h6>
</body>
Save your file as hr.html. Launch a browser to test your page. It should look similar to
the page shown in Figure 2.5. You can compare your work with the solution found in the
student files (chapter2/hr.html).

FIGURE 2.5 The horizontal line is below the paragraph.

When you are tempted to use a horizontal rule on a web page, consider whether it is really
needed. Usually, just leaving extra blank space on the page will serve to separate the
content.

34 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

Besides organizing text in paragraphs and headings, sometimes you need to add a quota-
tion to a web page. The blockquote element is used to display a block of quoted text in a

special way—indented from both the left and right margins. A block of indented text begins
with a <blockquote> tag and ends with a </blockquote> tag.
Figure 2.6 shows a web page document with a heading, a paragraph, and a blockquote.

Blockquote
Element

FIGURE 2.6 The text within the blockquote
element is indented.

You’ve probably noticed how convenient the <blockquote> tag could be if you needed
to indent an area of text on a web page. You may have wondered whether it would be OK to
use <blockquote> anytime you’d like to indent text or whether the blockquote element is
reserved only for long quotations. The semantically correct usage of the <blockquote> tag is to use it
only when displaying large blocks of quoted text within a web page. Why should you be concerned about
semantics? Consider the future of the Semantic Web, described in Scientific American as “A new form of
Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities.” Using HTML
in a semantic, structural manner is one step toward the Semantic Web. So, avoid using a <blockquote>
just to indent text. You’ll learn modern techniques to configure margins and padding on elements later in
this book.

Blockquote Element 35

Hands-On Practice 2.5
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.6, launch a text editor and open the
template.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the text in the title
element. Add a heading tag, a paragraph tag, and a blockquote tag to the body section as
indicated by the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Blockquote Example</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>The Power of the Web</h1>
<p>According to Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web,
at https://www.w3.org/Press/IPO-announce:
</p>
<blockquote>
The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential aspect.
</blockquote>
</body>
</html>
Save the document as blockquote.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser
such as Edge or Firefox to test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in
Figure 2.6. You can compare your work with the solution found in the student files
(chapter2/blockquote.html).

Why does my web page still look the same?
Often, students make changes to a web page but get frustrated because their browser
shows an older version of the page. The following troubleshooting tips are helpful when
you know you have modified your web page, but the changes do not show up in the browser:
1. Be sure to save your web page file after you make changes.
2. Verify the location where you save your file—the hard drive, a particular folder.
3. Verify the location from where your browser is requesting the file—the hard drive, a particular folder.
4. Be sure to click the web browser Refresh or Reload button.

36 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

A phrase element indicates the context and meaning of the text between the container
tags. It is up to each browser to interpret that style. Phrase elements are displayed directly
in line with the text (referred to as inline display) and can apply to either a section of text or
even a single character of text. For example, the <strong> element indicates that the text
associated with it has strong importance and should be displayed in a “strong” manner in
relation to normal text on the page.
Table 2.1 lists common phrase elements and examples of their use. Notice that some tags,
such as <cite> and <dfn>, result in the same type of display (italics) as the <em> tag in
today’s browsers. These tags semantically describe the text as a citation or definition, but
the physical display is usually italics in both cases.

Phrase Element

Element Example Usage
<abbr> WIPO Identifies text as an abbreviation
<b> bold text Has no extra importance but is styled in bold font
<cite> cite text Identifies a citation or reference; usually displayed in italics
<code> code text Identifies program code samples; usually a fixed-space font
<dfn> dfn text Identifies a definition of a word or term; usually displayed in italics
<em> emphasized text Causes text to be emphasized; usually displayed in italics
<i> italicized text Has no extra importance but is styled in italics
<kbd> kbd text Identifies keyboard input; usually has a fixed-space font
<mark> mark text Highlights text in order to be easily referenced
<q> “quoted” text Indicates a short quote; usually displays quotation marks
<samp> samp text Shows program sample output; usually a fixed-space font
<small> small text Defines a smaller text
<strong> strong text Strong importance; usually displayed in bold
<sub> subtext Displays a subscript as small text below the baseline
<sup> suptext Displays a superscript as small text above the baseline
<var> var text Identifies and displays a variable output; usually displayed in italics
TABLE 2.1 Phrase Elements

Phrase Element 37

Note that all phrase elements are container tags—both an opening and a closing tag is
used. As shown in Table 2.1, the <strong> element indicates that the text associated with
it has “strong” importance. Usually the browser (or other user agent) will display <strong>
text in bold type. A screen reader, such as JAWS or Window-Eyes, might interpret <strong>
text to indicate that the text should be more strongly spoken. In the following line, the
phone number is displayed with strong importance:
Call for a free quote for your web development needs: 888.555.5555
The code follows:
<p>Call for a free quote for your web development needs:
<strong>888.555.5555</strong></p>
Notice that the opening <strong> and closing <strong> tags are within the paragraph
tags (<p> and </p>). This code is properly nested and is considered to be well-formed.
When improperly nested, the <p> and <strong> tag pairs overlap each other instead of
being nested within each other. Improperly nested code will not pass validation testing (see
the HTML Syntax Validation section later in this chapter) and may cause display issues.
Figure 2.7 shows a web page document (also found in the student files at chapter2/em.html)
that uses the <em> tag to display the emphasized phrase, “Access by everyone,” in italics.

The code snippet follows:
<blockquote>
The power of the Web is in its universality.
<em>Access by everyone</em> regardless of disability is an essential
aspect.
</blockquote>

FIGURE 2.7 The <em> tag in action.

38 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

Lists are used on web pages to organize information. When writing for the Web, head-
ings, short paragraphs, and lists can make your page more clear and easy to read. HTML

can be used to create three types of lists—description lists, ordered
lists, and unordered lists. All lists are rendered as block display with
empty space above and below. This section focuses on the ordered
list, which displays a numbering or lettering system to sequence the

information in the list. An ordered list can be organized using numer-
als (the default), uppercase letters, lowercase letters, uppercase

Roman numerals, and lowercase Roman numerals. See Figure 2.8 for
a sample ordered list.

Ordered lists begin with an <ol> tag and end with an </ol> tag. Each list item begins with
an <li> tag and ends with an </li> tag. The code to configure the heading and ordered
list shown in Figure 2.8 follows:
<h1>My Favorite Colors</h1>
<ol>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Teal</li>
<li>Red</li>
</ol>
The type, start, and reversed Attributes
The type attribute configures the symbol used for ordering the list. For example, to create
an ordered list organized by uppercase letters, use <ol type="A">. Table 2.2 documents
the type attribute and its values for ordered lists.

Ordered List

FIGURE 2.8 Sample ordered list.

Another handy attribute that can be used with ordered lists is the start attribute, with
which you can specify the start value for the list (for example, start="10"). Use the
reversed attribute (reversed="reversed") to indicate that a list is in descending
order.

Value Symbol
1 Numerals (the default)
A Uppercase letters
a Lowercase letters
I Roman numerals
i Lowercase Roman numerals
TABLE 2.2 The type Attribute for Ordered Lists

Ordered List 39

Hands-On Practice 2.6
In this Hands-On Practice, you will use a heading and an
ordered list on the same page. To create the web page shown
in Figure 2.9, launch a text editor and open the template.html
file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the title
element and add h1, h2, ol, and li tags to the body section, as
indicated by the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Heading and List</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>My Favorite Colors</h1>
<ol>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Teal</li>
<li>Red</li>
</ol>
</body>
</html>
Save your file as ol.html. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar to the
page shown in Figure 2.9. You can compare your work with the solution in the student files
(chapter2/ol.html).
Take a few minutes to experiment with the type attribute. Configure the ordered list
to use uppercase letters instead of numerals. Save your file as ola.html. Test your
page in a browser. You can compare your work with the solution in the student files
(chapter2/ola.html).

FIGURE 2.9 An ordered list.

Why is the web page code in the examples indented?
Actually, it doesn’t matter to the browser if web page code is indented,
but humans find it easier to read and maintain code when it is logically
indented. This makes it easier for you or another web developer to understand the
source code in the future. For example, it’s common practice to indent <li> tags a
few spaces in from the left margin because it makes it easier to “see” the list with a
quick glance at the source code. There is no “rule” as to how many spaces to indent.
However, your instructor or the organization you work for may have a standard for you
to follow. Web pages with consistent indentation are easier to maintain.

40 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

An unordered list displays a bullet, or list marker, before each list entry. The default list
marker is determined by the browser but is typically a disc, which is a filled-in circle.
See Figure 2.10 for a sample unordered list.
Unordered List

FIGURE 2.10 Sample unordered list.

Unordered lists begin with a <ul> tag and end with a </ul> tag. The ul element is a block
display element and is rendered with empty space above and below. Each list item begins

with an <li> tag and ends with an </li> tag. The code to configure the heading and unor-
dered list shown in Figure 2.10 is as follows:

<h1>My Favorite Colors</h1>
<ul>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Teal</li>
<li>Red</li>
</ul>

Can I change the “bullet” in an unordered list?
Back in the day before HTML5, the type attribute could be included with a <ul>
tag to change the default list marker to a square (type="square") or open circle
(type="circle"). However, be aware that using the type attribute on an unordered list is considered
obsolete in HTML5 because it is decorative and does not convey meaning. No worries, though—there
are CSS techniques to configure list markers (bullets) to display images and shapes.

Unordered List 41

Hands-On Practice 2.7

In this Hands-On Practice, you will use a heading and an unor-
dered list on the same page. To create the web page shown in

Figure 2.11, launch a text editor and open the template.html
file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the
title element and add h1, ul, and li tags to the body section as
indicated by the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Heading and List</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<h1>My Favorite Colors</h1>
<u1>
<li>Blue</li>
<li>Teal</li>
<li>Red</li>
</ul>
</body>
</html>
Save your file as ul.html. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look similar to
the page shown in Figure 2.11. You can compare your work with the solution in the student
files (chapter2/ul.html).

FIGURE 2.11 An unordered list.

42 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

A description list can be used to organize terms and their descriptions. The terms stand out
and their descriptions can be as long as needed to convey your message. Each term begins
on its own line at the margin. Each
description begins on its own line
and is indented. Description lists

are also handy for organizing Fre-
quently Asked Questions (FAQs) and

their answers. The questions and
answers are offset with indentation.

Any type of information that con-
sists of a number of corresponding

terms and associated descriptions
is well suited to being organized in a
description list. See Figure 2.12 for
an example of a web page that uses
a description list.
Description lists begin with the <dl>
tag and end with the </dl> tag.
Each term or name in the list begins
with the <dt> tag and ends with the
</dt> tag. Each term description
begins with the <dd> tag and ends
with the </dd> tag.

Hands-On Practice 2.8
In this Hands-On Practice, you will use a heading and a description list on the same
page. To create the web page shown in Figure 2.12, launch a text editor and open the
template.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the title element and
add h1, dl, dd, and dt tags to the body section as indicated by the following code:

Description List

FIGURE 2.12 A description list.

Description List 43

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<dt>TCP</dt>
<dd>Transmission Control Protocol is a method (protocol) used along
with the Internet Protocol (IP) to send data in the form of message
units, called packets, between computers over the Internet.</dd>

<dt>HTTP</dt>
<dd>Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the protocol used for exchanging
text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files on the
Web.</dd>
</dl>
</body>
</html>
Save your file as description.html. Launch a browser and test your page. It should look
similar to the page shown in Figure 2.12. Don’t worry if the word wrap is a little different—

the important formatting is that each <dt> term should be on its own line and the corre-
sponding <dd> description should be indented under it. Try to resize your browser window

and notice how the word wrap on the description text changes. You can compare your work
with the solution in the student files (chapter2/description.html).

Why does the text in my web page wrap differently than the examples?
The text may wrap a little differently because your screen resolution or browser viewport
size may not be the same as those on the computer used for the screen captures. That’s

part of the nature of working with the Web—expect your web pages to look slightly different in the multi-
tude of screen resolutions, browser viewport sizes, and devices that people will use to view your designs.

44 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

In order to use special characters such as quotation marks, the greater than sign (>), the
less than sign (<), and the copyright symbol (©) in your web page document, you need to
use special characters, sometimes called entity characters.1 For example, if you want to
include a copyright line on your page as follows:
© Copyright 2022 My Company. All rights reserved.
you need to use the special character &copy; to display the copyright symbol, as shown
below:
&copy; Copyright 2022 My Company. All rights reserved.
Another useful special character is &nbsp;, which stands for nonbreaking space. You may

have noticed that web browsers treat multiple spaces as a single space. If you want mul-
tiple spaces to be displayed in your text, you can use &nbsp; multiple times to indicate

multiple blank spaces. This is acceptable if you simply need to tweak the position of an ele-
ment a little. If you find that your web pages contain many &nbsp; special characters in a

row, you should use a different method to align elements, such as configuring the margin or
padding with Cascading Style Sheets (see Chapter 6).
See Table 2.3 for a description of commonly used special characters and their codes.

Hands-On Practice 2.9
Figure 2.13 shows the web page you will create in this Hands-On Practice. Launch a text
editor and open the template.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student files.
Change the title of the web page to
“Web Design Steps” by modifying the
text between the <title> and
</title> tags.
The sample page shown in Figure 2.13
contains a heading, an unordered list,
and the copyright information. You will
add these elements to your file next.
Configure the phrase, “Web Design
Steps”, as a level 1 heading (<h1>)
as follows:
<h1>Web Design Steps</h1>
Now create the unordered list. The first
line of each bulleted item is the title of
the web design step. In the sample, each
step title should be strong or stand out
from the rest of the text. The code for the
beginning of the unordered list follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Determine the
Intended Audience</strong>
<br> The colors, images, fonts, and layout should be tailored to
the <em> preferences of your audience.</em> The type of site content
(reading level, amount of animation, etc.) should be appropriate for
your chosen audience.</li>

Edit your design.html file and code the entire unordered list shown in Figure 2.13. Remem-
ber to code the closing </ul> tag at the end of the list. Finally, configure the copyright

information in a paragraph and apply the small element. Use the special character &copy;
for the copyright symbol. The code for the copyright line follows:
<p><small>Copyright &copy; 2022 Your name. All Rights
Reserved.</small></p>

Save your file as design.html. Launch a browser and test your page. How did you do? Com-
pare your work to the sample in the student files (chapter2/design.html).

FIGURE 2.13 Sample design.html.

46 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

The W3C has a free Markup Validation Service available at http://validator.w3.org that will
check your code for syntax errors and validate your web pages. HTML validation provides
you with quick self-assessment—you can prove that your code uses correct syntax. In the
working world, HTML validation serves as a quality assurance tool. Invalid code may cause
browsers to render the pages slower than otherwise.

Hands-On Practice 2.10
In this Hands-On Practice, you will use the W3C Markup Validation Service to validate a web
page file. Launch a text editor and open the design.html file from the chapter2 folder in the
student files.

1. We will add an error to the design.html
page. Delete the first closing </strong>
tag. This modification should generate
several error messages.
2. Next, attempt to validate the design.html
file. Launch a browser and visit the W3C
Markup Validation Service file upload
page at http://validator.w3.org and
select the “Validate by File Upload” tab.
Click the Browse button and select the

chapter2/design.html file from your com-
puter. Click the Check button to upload

the file to the W3C site (Figure 2.14).
3. A results page will be displayed. Scroll
down the page to view the errors, as
shown in Figure 2.15.

4. Notice that the message indicates line 12, which is the first line after the missing
closing </strong> tag. HTML error messages often point to a line that follows the
error. The text of the message “End tag for li seen, but there were open elements”
lets you know that something is wrong. It’s up to you to figure out what it is. A good
place to start is to check your container tags and make sure they are in pairs. In this
case, that is the problem. You can scroll down to view the other errors. However,
since multiple error messages are often displayed after a single error occurs, it’s a
good idea to fix one item at a time and then revalidate.

In addition to the W3C validation service, there are other tools that you can use to check
the syntax of your code. Try out the validators at the following websites:
* Validator.nu: https://html5.validator.nu
* Freeformatter.com: https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html

6. Your display should be similar to that

shown in Figure 2.16. Notice the mes-
sage, “ Document checking completed. No

errors or warnings to show.” This means
that your page passed the validation test.
Congratulations, your web page is valid!

It’s a good practice to validate your web pages. However, when validating code, use com-
mon sense. Since web browsers still do not completely follow W3C recommendations,

there will be situations, such as when adding multimedia to a web page, when HTML
code configured to work reliably across a variety of browsers and platforms will not pass validation.

48 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

HTML5 introduces a number of semantic structural elements that can be used along with
the generic div element to configure specific areas on a web page. These new HTML5
header, nav, main, and footer elements are intended to be used in conjunction with div and

other elements to structure web page documents in a more meaningful manner that indi-
cates the purpose of each structural area. Figure 2.17 shows a diagram of a page (called

a wireframe) that indicates how the structure of a web page could be configured with the
header, nav, main, div, and footer elements.
The Div Element

The div element has been used for many years to configure a generic struc-
tural area or “division” on a web page as a block display with empty space

above and below. A div element begins with a <div> tag and ends with a
</div> tag. Use a div element when you need to format an area of a web

page that may contain other block display elements such as headings, para-
graphs, unordered lists, and even other div elements. You’ll use Cascading

Style Sheets (CSS) later in this book to style and configure the color, font,
and layout of HTML elements.

The Header Element
The purpose of the HTML5 header element is to contain the headings of either a web page
document or an area within the document such as a section or an article (more on the
section element and article element in Chapter 8). The header element begins with the
<header> tag and ends with the </header> tag. The header element is block display and
typically contains one or more heading level elements (h1 through h6).

The Nav Element
The purpose of the HTML5 nav element is to contain a section of navigation links. The
block display nav element begins with the <nav> tag and ends with the </nav> tag.

The Main Element
The purpose of the HTML5 main element is to contain the main content of a web page
document. The block display main element begins with the <main> tag and ends with the
</main> tag.

Structural Elements 49

The Footer Element
The purpose of the HTML5 footer element is to contain the footer content of a web page or
section of a web page. The block display footer element begins with the <footer> tag and
ends with the </footer> tag.
Hands-On Practice 2.11
In this Hands-On Practice, you will use structural elements
as you create the Trillium Media Design home page,
shown in Figure 2.18. Launch a text editor, and open the
template.html file from the chapter2 folder in the student
files. Edit the code as follows:
1. Modify the title of the web page by changing the text

between the <title> and </title> tags to Tril-
lium Media Design.

2. Position your cursor in the body section and code
the header element with the text, “Trillium Media
Design” in an h1 element:
<header>
<h1>Trillium Media Design</h1>
</header>
3. Code a nav element to contain text that will indicate
the main navigation for the website. Configure bold text (use the b element) and use the
&nbsp; special character to add extra blank space:
<nav>
<b>Home &nbsp; Services &nbsp; Contact</b>
</nav>
4. Code the content within a main element that contains the h2 and paragraph elements:
<main>
<h2>New Media and Web Design</h2>
<p>Trillium Media Design offers a comprehensive range of
services to take your company&apos;s Web presence to the next
level.</p>
<h2>Meeting Your Business Needs</h2>
<p>Our expert designers will listen to you as they create a website
that helps to promote and grow your business.</p>
</main>
5. Configure the footer element to contain a copyright notice displayed in small font size
(use the small element) and italic font (use the i element). Be careful to properly nest
the elements as shown here:
<footer>
<small><i>Copyright &copy; 2022 Your Name Here</i></small>
</footer>
Save your page as structure.html. Test your page in a browser. It should look similar
to Figure 2.18. You can compare your work to the sample in the student files
(chapter2/structure.html).

3. Code a nav element to contain text that will indicate the main navigation for the web-
site. Configure bold text (use the b element) and use the &nbsp; special character to

add extra blank space:
<nav>
<b>
Home &nbsp;
Rooms &nbsp;
Events &nbsp;
Contact
</b>
</nav>
4. Code the content within a main element. Start with the h2 and paragraph elements:
<main>
<h2>Stay in the Heart of Sedona</h2>
<p>At Casita Sedona Bed &amp; Breakfast you&apos;ll be close to
art galleries, shops, restaurants, hiking trails, and tours. Ride
the free trolley to shops and galleries.</p>
<h3>Luxurious Rooms</h3>
<p>Stay in a well-appointed room at Casita Sedona with your own
fireplace, king-size bed, and balcony overlooking the red rocks.</p>
</main>
5. Configure the company name, address, and phone number within a div element. Code
the div element within the main element before the closing main tag. Use line break
tags to display the name, address, and phone information on separate lines and to
create extra empty space before the footer:
<div>
<strong>Casita Sedona Bed &amp; Breakfast</strong><br>
612 Tortuga Lane<br>
Sedona, AZ 86336<br>
928-555-5555<br>
</div>
6. Configure the footer element to contain a copyright notice displayed in small font size
(use the small element) and italic font (use the i element). Be careful to properly nest
the elements as shown here:
<footer>
<small><i>Copyright &copy; 2022 Your Name Here</i></small>
</footer>
Save your page as casita.html. Test your page in a browser. It should look similar
to Figure 2.20. You can compare your work to the sample in the student files
(chapter2/casita.html).

52 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics
You’ve just worked with the HTML5 header, nav, main, and footer elements. These HTML5 elements are
used along with div and other elements to structure web page documents in a meaningful manner that
defines the purpose of the structural areas. In this section, you’ll explore more HTML5 structural elements.
The Section Element
The purpose of a section element is to indicate a “section” of a document, such as a chapter or topic. This
block display element could contain header, footer, section, article, aside, figure, div, and other elements
needed to configure the content.
The Article Element
The article element is intended to present an independent entry, such as a blog posting, comment, or e-zine
article that could stand on its own. This block display element could contain header, footer, section, aside,
figure, div, and other elements needed to configure the content.
The Aside Element
The aside element indicates a sidebar or other tangential content. This block display element could contain
header, footer, section, aside, figure, div, and other elements needed to configure the content.
The Time Element
The time element represents a date or a time. The time element is not a structural element, but it is
included here because it is useful to identity the date of content, such as an article on a web page or
a blog entry. An optional datetime attribute can be used to specify a calendar date and/or time in
machine- readable format.2 Use YYYY-MM-DD for a date. Use a 24-hour clock and HH:MM for time.

Hands-On Practice 2.13
In this Hands-On Practice, you’ll edit a web page document and apply the section, article, aside, and time
elements to create the page with blog postings shown in Figure 2.21.

54 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

Use the a element (commonly called the anchor element) to specify a hyperlink, often

referred to as a link, to another web page or file that you want to display. Each anchor ele-
ment begins with an <a> tag and ends with an </a> tag. The opening and closing anchor

tags surround the text that the user can click to perform the hyperlink. Use the href attri-
bute to configure the hyperlink reference, which identifies the name and location of the file to

access.
Figure 2.22 shows a web page document with an anchor tag that configures a hyperlink to
this book’s website, http://webdevbasics.net.
The code for the anchor tag in Figure 2.22 is as follows:
<a href="http://webdevbasics.net">Basics of Web Design Textbook
Companion</a>
Notice that the href value is the URL for the website and will display the home page. The
text that is typed between the two anchor tags displays on the web page as a hyperlink and
is underlined by most browsers. When you move the mouse over a hyperlink, the cursor
changes to a pointing hand, as shown in Figure 2.22.
Hands-On Practice 2.14
To create the web page shown in Figure 2.22, launch a text editor and open the template.html
file from the chapter2 folder in the student files. Modify the title element and add an anchor
tag to the body section as indicated by the following code:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<title>Anchor Example</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://webdevbasics.net">Basics of Web
Design Textbook Companion</a>
</body>
</html>

Save the document as anchor.html on your hard drive or flash drive. Launch a browser and
test your page. It should look similar to the page shown in Figure 2.22. You can compare
your work with the solution found in the student files (chapter2/anchor.html).

FIGURE 2.22 Sample hyperlink.

Can images be hyperlinks?

Yes. Although we’ll concentrate on text hyperlinks in this chapter, it is also possible to con-
figure an image as a hyperlink. You’ll get practice with image links in Chapter 5.

Anchor Element 55

Targeting Hyperlinks
You may have noticed in Hands-On Practice 2.14 that when a visitor clicks a hyperlink, the new
web page automatically opens in the same browser window. You can configure the target
attribute on an anchor tag with target="_blank" to open a hyperlink in a new browser
window or browser tab. Note that you cannot control whether the web page opens in a new
window or opens in a new tab—that is dependent on your visitor’s browser configuration. To
see the target attribute in action, try the example in the student files at chapter2/target.html.
Absolute Hyperlink

An absolute hyperlink indicates the absolute location of a resource on the Web. The hyper-
link in Hands-On Practice 2.14 is an absolute hyperlink. Use an absolute hyperlink when

you need to link to resources on other websites. The href value for an absolute hyperlink to

the home page of a website includes the http://protocol and the domain name. The follow-
ing hyperlink is an absolute hyperlink to the home page of this book’s website:

<a href="http://webdevbasics.net">Basics of Web Design</a>
Note that if we want to access a web page other than the home page on the book’s
website, we can also include a specific folder name and file name. For example, the
following anchor tag configures an absolute hyperlink for a file named chapter1.html
located in a folder named 6e on this book’s website:
<a href="http://webdevbasics.net/6e/chapter1.html">Chapter 1</a>
Relative Hyperlink
When you need to link to web pages within your site, use a relative hyperlink. The href
value for a relative hyperlink does not begin with http:// and does not include a domain
name. For a relative hyperlink, the href value will contain only the file name (or folder and
file name) of the web page you want to display. The hyperlink location is relative to the
page currently being displayed. For example, if you are coding a home page (index.html)
for a website and want to link to a page named contact.html located in the same folder as
index.html, you can configure a relative hyperlink as shown in the following code sample:
<a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>
Block Anchor
It’s typical to use anchor tags to configure phrases or even just a single word as a hyperlink.
HTML5 provides a new function for the anchor tag—the block anchor. A block anchor can
configure one or more entire elements (even those that display as a block, such as a div,
h1, or paragraph) as a hyperlink. See an example in the student files (chapter2/block.html).
Accessibility and Hyperlinks
Visually challenged visitors who are using a screen reader can configure the software to
display a list of the hyperlinks in the document. However, a list of hyperlinks is only useful
if the text describing each hyperlink is actually helpful and descriptive. For example, on your
college website, a “Search the course schedule” link would be more useful than a hyperlink
that simply says “More information” or “click here.” Keep this in mind as you are coding
hyperlinks in your web pages.

56 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

The best way to learn how to code web pages is by actually doing it! In this section, you’ll

create three pages in a small website so that you can practice using the anchor tag to con-
figure hyperlinks.

Site Map
Figure 2.23 displays the site map for your new website—a Home page with two content
pages: a Services page and a Contact page.

A site map represents the structure, or organization, of pages in a website
in a visual manner. Each page in the website is represented by a box on
the site map. Review Figure 2.23 and notice that the Home page is at the
top of the site map. The second level in a site map shows the other main
pages of the website. In this very small three-page website, the other two
pages (Services and Contact) are included on the second level. The main
navigation of a website usually includes hyperlinks to the pages shown on
the first two levels of the site map.

Hands-On Practice 2.15
Figure 2.23 displays the site map for your new website—a home page (index.html) with two
content pages: services page (services.html) and contact page (contact.html).
1. Create a Folder. If you had printed papers to organize, you would probably store

them in a paper folder. Web designers store and organize their computer files by cre-
ating a folder on a hard drive (or portable storage such as an SD card or a Flash drive)

for each website. This helps them to be efficient as they work with many different

How do I create a new folder?
Before you begin to learn how to code web pages, it’s a good idea to be comfortable using
your computer for basic tasks such as creating a new folder. If you don’t remember how to

create a folder, review Hands-On Practice 1.1 for instructions.

websites. You will organize your own web design work by creating a new folder for

each website and storing your files for that website in the new folder. Use your operat-
ing system to create a new folder named mypractice for your new website.

2. Create the Home Page. Use the Trillium Media Design web page (Figure 2.18)
from Hands-On Practice 2.11 as a starting point for your new home page (shown in
Figure 2.24). Copy the file from Hands-On Practice 2.11 (chapter2/structure.html) into

your mypractice folder. Change the file name of structure.html to index.html. It’s com-
mon practice to use the file name index.html for the home page of a website.

FIGURE 2.24 New index.html web page.
Launch a text editor and open the index.html file.
a. The navigation hyperlinks will be located within the nav element. You will edit the
code within the nav element to configure three hyperlinks:
◗ The text “Home” will hyperlink to index.html
◗ The text “Services” will hyperlink to services.html
◗ The text “Contact” will hyperlink to contact.html
Modify the code within the nav element as given below:
<nav>
<b>
<a href="index.html">Home</a> &nbsp;
<a href="services.html">Services</a> &nbsp;
<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</b>
</nav>
b. Save the index.html file in your mypractice folder. Test your page in a browser. It
should look similar to Figure 2.24. You can compare your work to the sample in the
student files (chapter2/2.15/index.html).

58 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basics

3. Create the Services Page. It is common practice to create a new web page based on

an existing page. You will use the index.html file as a starting point for the new Ser-
vices page, as shown in Figure 2.25.

FIGURE 2.25 The services.html web page.

Open your index.html file in a text editor and save the file as services.html. Edit the
code as indicated below:
a. Modify the title of the web page by changing the text between the <title> and

</title> tags to “Trillium Media Design - Services”. In order to create a con-
sistent header, navigation, and footer for the web pages in this website, do not

change the code within the header, nav, or footer elements.
b. Position your cursor in the body section and delete the code and text between
the opening and closing main tags. Code the main page content (heading 2 and
description list) for the Services page between the main tags as follows:
<h2> Our Services Meet Your Business Needs</h2>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Website Design</strong></dt>
<dd>Whether your needs are large or small, Trillium can get
you on the Web!</dd>
<dt><strong>E-Commerce Solutions</strong></dt>
<dd>Trillium offers quick entry into the e-commerce
marketplace.</dd>
<dt><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong></dt>
<dd>Most people find new sites using search engines.
Trillium can get your website noticed.</dd>
</dl>
c. Save the services.html file in your mypractice folder. Test your page in a browser. It
should look similar to Figure 2.25. You can compare your work to the sample in the
student files (chapter2/2.15/services.html).

Practice with Hyperlinks 59

4. Create the Contact Page. Use the
index.html file as a starting point for the
Contact page, as shown in Figure 2.26.
Launch a text editor, open index.html,
and save the file as contact.html.
Edit the code as indicated below:
a. Modify the title of the web page
by changing the text between the
<title> and </title> tags to
“Trillium Media Design - Contact”.
In order to create a consistent header,
navigation, and footer for the web
pages in this website, do not change
the code within the header, nav, or
footer elements.

b. Position your cursor in the body sec-
tion and delete the code and text

between the opening main tag and the closing main tag. Code the main page con-
tent for the Contact page between the main tags:

<h2>Contact Trillium Media Design Today</h2>
<ul>
<li>E-mail: contact@trilliummediadesign.com</li>
<li>Phone: 555-555-5555</li>
</ul>
c. Save the contact.html file in your mypractice folder. Test your page in a browser. It
should look similar to Figure 2.26. Test your page by clicking each link. When you
click the “Home” hyperlink, the index.html page should be displayed. When you click
the “Services” hyperlink, the services.html page should be displayed. When you
click the “Contact” hyperlink, the contact.html page should be displayed. You can
compare your work to the sample in the student files (chapter2/2.15/contact.html).
FIGURE 2.26 The contact.html web page.

What if my relative hyperlink doesn’t work?
Check the following:

◗ Did you save the files in the specified folder?
◗ Did you save the files with the names as requested? Use Windows Explorer or Finder (Mac users) to
verify the actual names of the files you saved.
◗ Did you type the file names correctly in the anchor tag’s href property? Check for typographical errors.
◗ When you place your mouse over a link, the file name of a relative link will be displayed in the status
bar in the lower edge of the browser window. Verify that this is the correct file name. On many
operating systems, such as UNIX or Linux, the use of uppercase and lowercase letters in file names
matters—make sure that the file name and the reference to it are in the same case.

60 Chapter 2 ◗ HTML Basic

The anchor tag can also be used to create e-mail hyperlinks. An e-mail hyperlink will
automatically launch the default mail program configured for the browser. It is similar to an
external hyperlink with the following two exceptions:
◗ It uses mailto: instead of http://.
◗ It launches the default e-mail application for the visitor’s browser with your e-mail
address as the recipient.
For example, to create an e-mail hyperlink to the e-mail address help@webdevbasics.net,
code the following:
<a href="mailto:help@webdevbasics.net">help@webdevbasics.net</a>
It is good practice to place the e-mail address both on the web page and within the anchor
tag. Not everyone has an e-mail program configured with his or her browser. By placing the
e-mail address in both places, you increase usability for all of your visitors.
Hands-On Practice 2.16
In this Hands-On Practice, you will modify the Contact page (contact.html) of the website
you created in Hands-On Practice 2.15 and configure an e-mail link in the page content
area. Launch a text editor and open the contact.html file from your mypractice folder. This
example uses the contact.html file found in the student files in the chapter2/2.15 folder.

E-Mail Hyperlinks

FIGURE 2.27 An e-mail hyperlink has been configured on the
Contact page.

E-Mail Hyperlinks 61

Configure the e-mail address in the content area as an e-mail hyperlink as given below:
<li>E-mail:
<a href="mailto:contact@trilliummediadesign.com">contact@trilliummediadesign.com</a>
</li>
Save and test the page in a browser. The browser display should look similar to the
page shown in Figure 2.27. Compare your work with the sample in the student files
(chapter2/2.16/contact.html).

Free web-based e-mail is offered by many providers, such as Google, Outlook, and so on.
You can create one or more free e-mail accounts to use when communicating with new
websites or signing up for free services, such as newsletters. This will help to organize your

e-mail into those you need to access and respond to right away (such as school, work, or personal mes-
sages) and those you can get to at your convenience.

Won’t displaying my actual e-mail address on a web page increase spam?
Yes and no. While it’s possible that some unethical spammers may harvest web pages
for e-mail addresses, the chances are that your e-mail application’s built-in spam filter
will prevent your inbox from being flooded with messages. When you configure an easily readable e-mail
hyperlink, you increase the usability of your website for your visitors in the following situations:
◗ The visitor may be at a public computer with no e-mail application configured. In this case, when
the e-mail hyperlink is clicked, an error message may display, and the visitor will have difficulty
contacting you using the e-mail link.
◗ The visitor may be at a private computer but may prefer not to use the e-mail application (and

address) that is configured by default to work with the browser. Perhaps he or she shares the com-
puter with others, or perhaps he or she wishes to preserve the privacy of the default e-mail address.

If you prominently displayed your actual e-mail address, in both of these situations, the visitor can still
access your e-mail address and use it to contact you (in either their e-mail application or via a web-based
e-mail system such as Google’s Gmail). The result is a more usable website for your visitors.
